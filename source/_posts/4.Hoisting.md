    //code 1
    a = 2;
    var a;
    console.log(a); //2

    //above code 1 is actually equal to below
    var a; //compliation
    a = 2; //execution
    console.log(a);//2

    //code 2
    console.log(a);//undefined
    var a = 2;

    //above code 2 is actually equal to below
    var a;
    console.log(a);//undefined
    a = 2;
The Engine actually compile javascript code before interprets it.Part of the compilation phase was to find and associate all declarations with their appropriate scopes.

Variable and function declarations are moved from where they appear in the flow of the code to the top of the code,which name "Hoisting".

Declaration comes before the assignment.

    //function declaration is hoisted
    function foo(){
    var a;
    console.log(a);//undefined
    a = 2;
    }
    foo();

    //function expression can not be hoisted
    /**
    **'foo' is hoisted and attached to the enclosing scope(global).so not fail as a ReferenceError
    **'foo' has no value yet(as\it would if it had been a true function declaration instead of expression)
    **foo() is attempting to invoke the undefined value,which is a TypeError illeagal operation
    **/
    foo();//not ReferenceError but TypeError.
    var foo = function bar(){
        //...
    };

    //even it's a named function expression,the name identifier is not available in the enclosing scope
    foo();//TypeError
    bar();//ReferenceError

    var foo = function bar(){
        //...
    };
    //above code interpreted with hoisting as
    var foo;
    foo();//TypeError
    bar();//ReferenceError

    foo = function(){
        var bar = ...self...
        //...
    }


Both function and variable declarations are hoisted.But functions are hoisted first,and then variables.

    foo();//1
    var foo;//duplicate(and thus ignored) declaration. 
    function foo(){
        console.log(1);
    }
    foo = function(){
        console.log(2);
    };

    //above code is interpreted by engine as:
    function foo(){
        console.log(1);
    }
    foo();//1
    foo = function(){
        console.log(2);
    };

    //multiple/duplicate 'var' declarations are effectively ignored,subsequent function declarations do override previous ones
    foo();//3
    function foo(){
        console.log(1);
    }
    var foo = function(){
        console.log(2);
    };
    function foo(){
        console.log(3);
    }

    //function declarations hoist to the enclosing scope even inside od normal blocks,rather than being controlled by 'if'
    foo();//'b'
    var a = true;
    if(a){
        function foo(){console.log("a");}
    }else{
        function foo(){console.log("b");}
    }
