title: 2.Functions As Scopes
---

The scope-based hiding tend to arise from the doftware design principle "Principle of Least Privilege",also sometimes called "Least Authority" or "Least Exposure".This principle states that in the design of software,such as the API for a module/object,you should expose only what is minimally necessary,and "hide" everything else.

    function foo(a){
    var b = 2;
    //...

    function bar(){
          //...
    }
    //...
    var c = 3;
    }
    bar();//ReferenceError
    console.log(a,b,c);//ReferenceError
   
    /** dangerous ways to declare variable b and doSomethingElse(..) outside the doSomething(..)
    ** give the enclosing scope "access" to 'b' and doSomethingElse(..)
    **/
    function doSomething(a){
    b = a + doSomethingElse(a*2);
    console.log(b*3);
    }
    function doSomethingElse(a){
    return a-1;
    }
    var b;
    doSomething(2);//15

    /**resonable design to hide these private variables and functions inside doSomething(..)
    ** 'b' and doSomethingElse(..) are not accessible to any outside influence,onl controlled by doSomething(..)
    **/
    function doSomething(a){
    function doSomethingElse(a){
        return a-1;
    }
    var b;
    b = a + doSomethingElse(a*2);
    console.log(b*3);
    }
    doSomething(2);//15

    /**hide the variables and functions in a special scope can avoid collision
    **/
    function foo(){
    function bar(a){
         i = 3;//overwrite the 'i' declared in foo(..) at the for-loop,fix with 'var i = 3;' or 'var j = 3;'
         console.log(a+i);
    }
    for(var i=0;i<10;i++){
        bar(i*2);//infinite loop
    }
    }
    foo();

    //use scope to hide the inner declaretion inside is the best way.

    //global namespace
    /**
    **Loaded Libraries can create an object with a sufficiently unique name in the global scope.
    **This object is used as a namesapce for the library.
    **all specific exposures of functionality are made as the properties of the object.
    **/
    var MyReallyCoolLibrary = {
    awesome:"stuff",
    doSomething:function(){
        //...
    },
    doAnotherThing:function(){
        //...
    }

The scope-based hiding tend to arise from the doftware design principle "Principle of Least Privilege",also sometimes called "Least Authority" or "Least Exposure".This principle states that in the design of software,such as the API for a module/object,you should expose only what is minimally necessary,and "hide" everything else.
 

    var a = 2;
    function foo(){
    var a = 3;
    console.log(a); //3
    }
    foo();
    console.log(a);//2

    /**
    **It would be more ideal if the function didn't need a name(rather the name didn't pollute the enclosing scope).
    **And the function could automatically be executed.
    **/
    var a = 2;
    (function foo(){
        var a = 3;
        console.log(a); //3
    })();
    console.log(a);//2
The wrapping statement starts with '(function...' is treated as a function-expression.While start with 'function...' is a standard function declaration.

In the function declaration,the name 'foo' is bound in the enclosing scope,can call it directly with 'foo()'.'(function foo(){..})'as an expression means the identifier 'foo' is found only in the scope where '..' indicates,not in the outer scope.Hiding the name 'foo' inside itself means it does not pollute the enclosing scope unnecessarily.


    //Anonymous function expression
    SetTimeout(function(){
        console.log("I waited 1 second!");},1000);
    //Named function expression
    SetTimeout(function timeoutHandler(){
        console.log("I waited 1 second!");},1000);

Inline function expressions are powerful and useful -- the question of anonymous vs.named doesn't detract from that.Still,there are serval draw-backs to consider:

Anonoymous functions have no useful name to display in stack traces,which can manke debugging more difficult.
Without a name,if the function needs to refer to itself,for recuresion,etc.the deprecated 'arguments.callee' reference is unfortunately required.Another example of needing to self-reference is when an event handler function wants to unbind itself after it fires.
Anonymous functions omit a name that is often helpful in providing more readable code.


    var a = 2;
    (function foo(){
        var a = 3;
        console.log(a);//3
    })();
    console.log(a);//2
IIFE : Immediately Invoked Function Expression.The most common form of IIFE is to use an anonymous function expression.

There are two ways to wirte a IIFE.'(function(){ .. }( ))' or '(function(){ .. })( )'.

Use IIFE as function calls and pass in arguments.

    var a = 2;
    (function IIFE(global){
        var a = 3;
        console.log(a);//3
        console.log(global.a);//2
    })(window);
    console.log(a);//2
By naming a parameter 'undefined' , but not passing any value for that argument, we can guarantee that the 'undefined' identifier is in fact the undefined value.

    undefined = true;//setting a land-mine for other code!avoid!
    (function IIFE(undefined){
        var a;
        if(a==undefined){
            console.log("Undefined is safe here!");
        }
    })();
Another usage is to inverts the order of things,where the function to execute is given second, after the invocation and parameters to pass to it.This pattern is used in the UMD(Universal Module Definition)project.

    var a = 2;
    (function IIFE(def){
        def(window);
    })(function def(global){
        var a = 3;
        console.log(a);//3
        console.log(global.a);//2
    });
