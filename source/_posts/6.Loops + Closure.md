title: 6.Loops + Closure

    for(var i = 1;i<=5;i++){
        setTimeout(function timer(){
            console.log(i);
        },i*1000);
    }//u get '6' printed out 5 times,at the one-second intervals
    //That's why we need a new closured scope for each iteration of the loop

    //IIFE create scope by declaring a function and immediately executing it
    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
        (function(){
            setTimeout(function timer(){
                console.log(i);
            },i*1000);
        })();
    }//it's not enough to have a scope to close over if that scope is empty

    //IIFE should has its own variables,to with a copy of the value of i at each iterator
    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
        (function(){
            var j = i;
            setTimeout(function timer(){
                console.log(j);
            },j*1000);
        })();
    }
    //improve above code a little bit
    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
        (function(j){
            setTimeout(function timer(){
                console.log(j);
            },j*1000);
        })(i);
    }//since IIFEs are functions,pass 'i' in it,and call it 'j'.u can call it 'i' again if u like
The use of an IIFE inside each iteration created a new scope for each iteration,which give timeout function callbacks the opportunity to close over a new scope for each iteration,one which had a variable with the right per-iteration value in it for us to access.

In other words,we actually needed a per-iteration block scope.'let' declaration essentially turns a block into a scope that we can close over.

    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
        let j=i;//block-scope FOR closure
        setTimeout(function timer(){
            console.log(j);
        },j*1000);
    }

    //BLOCK SCOPING AND CLOSURE WORKING HAND-IN-HAND
    for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){
        setTimeout(function timer(){
            console.log(i);},i*1000);
    }
'let' declarations used in the head of a for-loop.This behavior says that the variable will be declared not just once for the loop,but each iteration.And it will,be initialized at each subsequent iteration with the value from the end of the previous iteration.
