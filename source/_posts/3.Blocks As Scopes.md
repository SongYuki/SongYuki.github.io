title: 3.Blocks As Scope

    for(var i=0;i<10;i++){
        console.log(i);
    }

    var foo = true;
    if(foo){
        var bar = foo*2;
        bar = something(bar);
        console.log(bar);
    }
Block-scoping is all about declaring variables as close as possible,as local as possible,to where they will be used.

Block-scope is a tool to extend the earlier "Principle of Least Exposure"from hiding information in functions to hiding information in blocks.


'with' is a form of block scope,in that the scope that is created from the object only exists for the lifetime of that 'with' statement,and not in the enclosing scope.



The 'catch' clause of a 'try/catch' is a block-scoped block.

    try{
        undefined();//illegal operation to force an exception
    }
    catch(err){
        console.log(err);//works
    }
    console.log(err);//ReferenceError:'err' not found


The 'let' keyword attaches the variable declaration to the scope of whatever block(commonly a { .. } pair) it's contained in.'let' implicitly hijacks any block's scope for its variable declaration.

    var foo = true;
    if(foo){
        let bar = foo*2;
        bar = something(bar);
     console.log(bar);

        //declarations will not observably "exist" in the block until the declare-statement
        {
         console.log(bar);//ReferenceError
        let bar = 2;
        }
    }
    console.log(bar);//ReferenceError
Another reason block-scoping is useful relates to closures and garbage collection to reclaim memory.

    /**
    **The click function click handler callback doesn't need the 'someReallyBigData' variable at all.
    **/
    function process(data){
        //do something interesting
    }
    var someReallyBigData = {..};

    process(someReallyBigData);

    var btn = document.getElementById("my_button");

    btn.addEventListener("click",function click(evt){
        console.log("button clicked");
    },/*capturingPhase=*/false);
Block-scoping can make it clearer to the engine that it doesn't need to keep 'someReallyBigData' around

    function process(data){
        //do something interesting
    }
    //anything declared inside this block can destroy after
    //declare explicit blocks for variables to locally bind to is a powerful tool.
    {
        let someReallyBigData = { .. };
        process(someReallyBigData);
    }
    var btn = document.getElementById("my_button");

    btn.addEventListener("click",function click(evt){
        console.log("button clicked");
    },/*capturingPhase=*/false);
'let loops' can be used in the for-loop case and it re-binds the variable to each iteration of the loop.

    for(let i=0;i<10;i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i);//ReferenceError

    //the per-iteration binding behavior
    {
        let j;
        for(j=0;j<10;j++){
            let i = j; //re-bind for each iteration
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
'let' declarations attach to arbitraty blocks rather than to the enclosing function's scope(or global).

    var foo = true,baz = 10;
    if(foo){
        let bar = 3;
        if(baz>bar){
            console.log(baz);
        }
    }

    //above code should be re-factored as
    var foo = true,baz = 10;
    if(foo){
        let bar = 3;
        //...
    }
    if(baz>bar){
        let bar = 3;
        console.log(baz);
    }
'const' also creates a block-scoped variable,but whose value is constant.Any attempt to change that value at a later time results in an error.

    var foo = true;
    if(foo){
        var a = 2;
        const b = 3;//block-scoped to the containing 'if'

        a = 3;//ok
        b = 4;//error
    }
    console.log(a);//3
    console.log(b);//ReferenceError
